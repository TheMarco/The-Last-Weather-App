The Last Weather App
=================

Copyright &copy; 2013 by Marco van Hylckama Vlieg.

A humorous weather app for BlackBerry&reg; 10 with social media sharing and BBM connectivity. The number 1 weather app for BlackBerry&reg; 10. In it's current form, this code will only run on BlackBerry&reg; 10 because it depends on the WebWorks framework for large parts of it's functionality.

## Features

This app contains many BlackBerry&reg; specific features. Study the code and learn!

* GPS geolocation
* BBM Invite Friend
* Invocation (Sharing)
* On-the-fly image generation
* Filesystem operations
* Active Covers (view when app is minimized)

## Some extra terms and conditions

This app is based on a concept screenshot I saw online one day. It was attributed to Tobias van Schneider. I have contacted him by email to let him know about this app and subsequently agreed with him that I will keep the app free, credit him for the original concept and don't port the app to iOS because he will launch his version on that platform himself.

While I can't stop anyone from using this code to create an iOS app (free or paid) and/or paid apps on BlackBerry&reg; 10 or other platforms I strongly suggest that you don't. Being nice really goes a long way. If anyone wants to make a FREE port for a platform other than iOS then I suppose that's acceptable. However please DO give credit where credit's due. Especially to Tobias van Schneider.

I've decided to make this code Open Source so other BlackBerry&reg; WebWorks developers can take a look at it and maybe learn something for their own apps.
